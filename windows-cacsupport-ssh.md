# Instructions for CAC Authentication in Windows Using PuttyCac.exe

---

## Description

You may use the [PuTTY-CAC agent](https://www.github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases) to connect to ssh targets.

## Instructions

Instructions for setting up CAC SSH and exporting public SSH keys under windows may be found at the [IdManagement.Gov Website](https://piv.idmanagement.gov/engineering/ssh/).

## Notes

If you installed your ssh key using ssh-copy-id per the [CacSupport Repository Linux-CacSupport-Ssh.sh Script](https://github.com/drpresq/cacsupport/blob/main/linux-cacsupport-ssh.sh), you should select your Signature Certificate in PuTTY-CAC.
